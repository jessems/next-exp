# Declarative Actions

Declarative Actions are a way of defining buttons and what those buttons do within Configurable Workspaces in a declarative way.

A declarative approach in computer science is a style of building elements within a system whereby you focus only on the _what_ and not the _how_.

Similarily Declarative Actions within ServiceNow allow you to describe what type of button you want to create and where you want it to show up, without having to worry about how it will be created.

One major benefit to this approach is that by outsourcing the "how" to ServiceNow, your button definition will be very robust to future changes in the platform, even when the "how" changes.
