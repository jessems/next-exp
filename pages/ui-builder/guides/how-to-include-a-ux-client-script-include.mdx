The go-to way to run scripts in UI Builder, and therefor in Next Experience and Configurable workspaces, is by writing `sys_ux_client_scripts`.

Sometimes you have code that you want to re-use across `sys_ux_client_scripts`. In those cases you can encapsulate that code in a `sys_ux_client_script_include` and include it in multiple `sys_ux_client_scripts`. Here's how.

```js filename="sys_ux_client_script_include"
// Scope: my_app
return {
    helloWorld() {
        console.log('Hello World');
    };
}
```

```js filename="sys_ux_client_script"
includes['my_app.MyScriptInclude'].helloWorld(); // Output: Hello World
```
